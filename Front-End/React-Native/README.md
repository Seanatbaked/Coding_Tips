## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

React Native apps may target iOS 9.0 and Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like [Expo](https://expo.io) can be used to work around this.

## ðŸŽ‰ Building your first React Native app

Assuming that you have Node 10+ installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

```
expo init AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start # you can also use: expo start
```
This will start a development server for you.
