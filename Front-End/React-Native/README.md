## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

React Native apps may target iOS 9.0 and Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like [Expo](https://expo.io) can be used to work around this.

## ðŸŽ‰ Building your first React Native app

Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). The recommended way to install React Native depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:

- [Creating a New Application][new-app]
- [Adding React Native to an Existing Application][existing]
